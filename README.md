# Chrome_Monkey
I recreated the Google TRex game with different models. Program is in python and mainly uses pygame. Models made by @gounu_ on twt
This was a fun project that I made with the help of a couple online forums and tutorials about how GitHub and Pygame work. 

It is based on monkeys since a friend of mine loves monkeys, I thought he might enjoy this project a lot. 


Thanks for exploring this
